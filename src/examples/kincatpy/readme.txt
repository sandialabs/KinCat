In order to produce a model dictionary, KinCatPy needs to be run. An example input file for the RuO2 system is given in ruo2_input.txt . 
It is run using the command:
python ./path_to_file/kincat_release1.py ruo2_input.txt

Several output files are produced and stored in a directory. The default is a local directory named CALC, but another may be specified in the input file if desired. The KinCat_input.json file is the model dictionary.
